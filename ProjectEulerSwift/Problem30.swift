 Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
 
 1634 = 14 + 64 + 34 + 44
 8208 = 84 + 24 + 04 + 84
 9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44
 As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.
 
 The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
 
 Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
